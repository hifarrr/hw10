# Screaming child

I propose to build a object that displays different emotion when people approach it.

# Summary

This object will have a moving webcam which will tilts and pans to search a human face. When someone tries to approach it, it will produce loud sound and start to search for the face. After it detects the face, it will compare the face with the face in its database. If it is the same one, it will stop scream. 

The main goal of this project is to create a exclusive toy that only the owner can play with it while other will only recieve scream when try to approach it. Like a child does, this toy will go over the process of perception, action and cognition.

# Component Parts

Hardware:
Webcam, motor, motion sensor,screen, device that makes sound.

Software:
data?

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for me is that I don't really know how to start my project. I am not familiar with arduino or programming. And I don't know what component should my project have either.

# Timeline

Week 1: Figure out all the parts and purchase them. Do research and watch tutorial.
Week 2: Code and prototype without the object.
Week 3: Code and prototype without the object.
Week 4: Build the prototype with the rough object and make it functional.
Week 5: Present!
